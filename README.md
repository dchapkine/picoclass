### About

Picoclass.js is a lightweight javascript class builder for browsers and nodejs.

Its unique goal is to simplify the way we write the equivalent of 'classical object oriented code' (inspired by php5.3 / C# / Java) in javascript.

Picoclass.js is also very small (and WILL stay small): 300 loc. 100 of them are comments ;-)

Take a look at [demo page](http://dchapkine.github.com/picoclass/) to learn how to use it.
